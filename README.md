The Online University Entrance Examination System is a web-based platform developed using PHP and JavaScript to help students prepare for university entrance exams. It provides interactive quizzes, study materials, and practice tests designed to improve students’ readiness and confidence. The system allows users to take subject-based quizzes, receive instant feedback, and track their performance over time. In addition, it offers organized learning resources that cover key exam topics. The project aims to make exam preparation more accessible, efficient, and engaging, especially for students with limited access to traditional study materials.
